##Web Platform Docs and Mozilla Developer Network
Googling for answers on the web can sometimes lead you finding a solution that worked for someone else in a specific context,
but may not actually be a solution that will work long term or give you a good understanding of _why_ a solution works. Both
[Web Platform Docs](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
are resources that explain how an HTML tag or CSS property is interpreted by the browser, what pitfall may occur, and if
the element or property is recognized by a browser.

##Codecademy
If you want to learn a little more about CSS or HTML (or Javascript, or Python, or PHP ...), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
is free and breakdown language aspects into bite-size chucks.

##CanIUse.com
[caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com) is a site that provides information about browser compatibility for various HTML,CSS, and SVG
tags.  If you are using some of the newer HTML5/CSS3 tags and attributes, this is a good site to check if it will work in
the browsers that you're building the app for.
