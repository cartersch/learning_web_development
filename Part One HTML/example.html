NOTES

Note 1 - The DOCTYPE tag is important to include because it tells the browser to use 'Standards' mode.
         While there are a few different types of Doctypes, the best one to use for modern web pages/applications
         is 'html' as it's the one that signifies this is an HTML5 page.

Note 2 - In the initial html tag, be sure to add a 'lang' attribute.  This attribute sets the original language
         of this document.  This helps with things like translations, search, and text-to-speech.

Note 3 - Inside the head tag, the 'title' tag is the only required element.

Note 4 - Make sure that you set character encoding to ensure your content is interpreted correctly.

Note 5 - The 'viewport' meta tag is starting to become a de-facto standard for many web pages/applications.
	     This sets window size of the web page/application which can then be used change styling and layout
	     on various devices.

Note 6 - Heading tags (h1,h2,etc.) help to build a document hierarchy. Headings can also be used by various
	     accessibility tools to navigate web pages/applications.

Note 7 - Whenever possible, keep any JavaScript at the bottom of the page.  This will ensure that
	     the HTML and CSS are rendered first before and JavaScript is executed.  If you were to place 'script' tags
	     inside the 'head' tag, the JavaScript would execute before the HTML is rendered.
