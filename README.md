Learning Web Development
========================

This repo is designed to a help a couple of interns at my employer, [Stewardship Technology](http://stewardshiptechnology.com), 
gain a better understanding of web development. This is meant to supplement some basic or beginner knowledge of web development.

The goal is to have separate folders for HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and maybe a few more. Each folder can contain the following:

- Example file: this will be a simple example file with notes embedded in the code to explain why I think certain things are important.
- Further Learning file: this will have links to other resources that may be helpful.
- Practice folder: this will have some resources and a small task to complete.
