        <p>
            This is paragraph. And this paragraph has a link that will
            send you to the <a href="https://google.com">Google home page</a>.
        </p>


        <div class="section">
            <p class="green">
                This paragraph is located inside a div tag with a class called 'section.'
                The paragraph itself has a class of 'green.'  In the stylesheet there is
                a rule reads '.section .green' that will apply specifically to this paragraph only.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="green">
            This paragraph also has a class of green, but it does not have the same styling as the paragraph above.
            Why? In the stylesheet we declared '.section .green' instead of say '.green' or even '.section, .green.'
            Therefore there is no style for anything that just has a class of '.green.'
        </p>


        <p class="section green"><!--Note 3-->
            This paragraph has two classes ('section' and 'green'). Even though there is a rule in our stylesheet that
            reads '.section .green', this is not the style sheet that is applied.  Instead, the one that is applied is
            the rule that read '.section.green' This is because '.section .green' is interpreted as any 'green' class
            that is inside an element with a 'section' class.  While '.section.green' is interpreted as any element that
            has both a 'section' class AND a 'green' class.

NOTES

Note 1 - To connect a CSS file to your HTML file use a 'link' tag inside the 'head' tag.
         The 'href' attribute holds the path to the CSS file.  This can be a relative path
         (like the one above) or a link to a external resource.

Note 2 - id's should always be unique for each page. Since I've used the id of 'title' on this page, 'title' should
         not be used on this page again.

Note 3 - you can have multiple classes on an element. In the 'class' attribute, just separate each class name with a
         space.
